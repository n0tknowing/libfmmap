libfmmap - helper library for memory-mapped files

the purpose of this library is to save my time dealing with mmap-family
functions while learning more about virtual memory.
performance is not *really* the goal but if you find this fast compared to
functions like read(), write(), fread(), fwrite(), etc. then it's good.

but, here are some limitation(s):
- only works on linux.

nevertheless, it's support basic file operations like creating, reading,
writing, and seeking. see examples/ if you want to know how to use it.

ok, now how do i add it to my project?
just copy fmmap.c and fmmap.h to your source tree.
